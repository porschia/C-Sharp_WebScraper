# C-Sharp_WebScraper

The purpose of this web scraper is to take a ticker symbol (or several) as well as a specific quarter and year, 
then retrieve the call transcript information from seekingalpha.com. The goal is to easily extract the call transcripts from 
different companies and then do word cloud evaluations on them and look for trends.
